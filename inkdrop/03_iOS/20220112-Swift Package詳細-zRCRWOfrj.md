## Target

```swift
/// Creates a regular target.
///
/// A target can contain either Swift or C-family source files, but not both. It contains code that is built as
/// a regular module that can be included in a library or executable product, but that cannot itself be used as
/// the main target of an executable product.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - name: The name of the target.
///   - dependencies: The dependencies of the target. A dependency can be another target in the package or a product from a package dependency.
///   - path: The custom path for the target. By default, the Swift Package Manager requires a target's sources to reside at predefined search paths;
///       for example, `[PackageRoot]/Sources/[TargetName]`.
///       Don't escape the package root; for example, values like `../Foo` or `/Foo` are invalid.
///   - exclude: A list of paths to files or directories that the Swift Package Manager shouldn't consider to be source or resource files.
///       A path is relative to the target's directory.
///       This parameter has precedence over the `sources` parameter.
///   - sources: An explicit list of source files. If you provide a path to a directory,
///       the Swift Package Manager searches for valid source files recursively.
///   - resources: An explicit list of resources files.
///   - publicHeadersPath: The directory containing public headers of a C-family library target.
///   - cSettings: The C settings for this target.
///   - cxxSettings: The C++ settings for this target.
///   - swiftSettings: The Swift settings for this target.
///   - linkerSettings: The linker settings for this target.
